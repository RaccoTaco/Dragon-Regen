# Dragon-Regen
1.10 Spigot/Bukkit ONLY

Must use Multiverse 2.5 in order to regerate the worlds! 2.6+ for some reason spews out errors for 1.10. 

Can also choose to have different dragons (op-dragon setting) or to increase the damage dealt by endermen (op-endermen setting). Dragon will spawn between minimum and maximum days. Will spawn with minimum to maximum health. Make sure to change the current world you want to regen on the dragon's death (NOTE: There must be a dragon inhabiting that world currently for the plugin to work - must be killed first to spawn in new dragon). Do not mess with respawn variable - it just gives a date as to when the dragon will appear next. 'NONE' means that there is a dragon currently spawned in the world.

Inspired by League of Legend's dragon variety.
